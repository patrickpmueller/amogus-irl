# Among us In Real Life

## Goal
This project aims to seamlessly integrate using a mobile device to facilitate some things when playing a game based on the popular video game `Among Us`, in real life.
Right now there should be a task list, meetings and death reporting, and role distribution with possible future integration for hardware-based tasks.

If someone is willing to contribute, please open an issue to discuss any changes *before* opening a PR.
